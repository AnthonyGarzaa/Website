<h1>The Things I Like!</h1>

<p>In this page I will talk about my personal likings and my hobbies!</p>

<h3>Music!!</h3>

<p>
    Most of my music taste ranges pop, jazz/big band, and rock'n'roll from the 20th century.
    Decades range from the 30's to the 70's (Maybe 80's). There's almost never a day where I 
    DON'T listen to music. It always lifts my spirits up, or makes me feel relaxed. Whether it's
    Spotify, on my record player, or my CD player, there's usually something blasting in my room
    more often than not.
