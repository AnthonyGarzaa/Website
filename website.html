<h1> All About Me</h1>

<p> Hello there! This website was created to act as my first DYOP and to talk a little bit about myself! </p>

<!-- I will be talking about myself in the following lines of code -->

<h3> Basic Info About Me!</h3>

    and I've grown up there ever since. I'm half Mexican and half Spaniard. I attend Carl Wunsche Senior
    High School. I'm currently a senior, and I've been here ever since freshmen year. High school started in 2016 for me,
    and my graduation year is 2020.
